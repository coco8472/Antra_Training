# Understanding Data Type

1. Data Type:

* (char) A person’s telephone number
* (float) A person’s height
* (byte) A person’s age
* (char) A person’s gender (Male, Female, Prefer Not To Answer)
* (decimal) A person’s salary
* (char) A book’s ISBN
* (decimal) A book’s price
* (float) A book’s shipping weight
* (double) A country’s population
* (decimal) The number of stars in the universe
* (ushort) The number of employees in each of the small or medium businesses in the United Kingdom (up to about 50,000 employees per business)

2. What are the difference between value type and reference type variables? What is boxing and unboxing?

* Value type will directly hode the value. Reference type will hold memory address or reference for its value.
* Value type will be stored in stack memory. Reference type will be stored in heap memory.
* Value type won't be collected by garbage collector. Reference type will.
* Value type can be created by Struct or Enum. Reference type can be created by classes, interfaces, delegates, arrays.
* Value type can't accept Null values. Reference type can

* Boxing means converting a value type into a reference type. Unboxing means conterting a reference type into a value type.

3. What is meant by the terms managed resource and unmanaged resource in .NET

* Managed means the resource is directly controlled by the garbage collector. And unmanaged means its not.

4. Whats the purpose of Garbage Collector in .NET?

* Garbage collector helps the engine performs better by releasing memory that can no longer be accessed.

# Controlling Flow and Converting Types
1. What happens when you divide an int variable by 0?
2. What happens when you divide a double variable by 0?
3. What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its range?
4. What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;?
5. What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop statement?
6. What are the three parts of a for statement and which of them are required?
7. What is the difference between the = and == operators?
8. Does the following statement compile? for ( ; true; ) ;
9. What does the underscore _ represent in a switch expression?
10. What interface must an object implement to be enumerated over by using the foreach
statement?
